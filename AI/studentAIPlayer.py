# values, then it returns the weighed average of the two weights. If it lies beyond the
# end of the list, it returns the last item in the list.
#
# Parameters:
#    raw        - The raw score which will be weighted (float or int)
#    weightList - The list to weigh the raw value with (list[float or int])
#
# Return:
#    The weighted value (float)
